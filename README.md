The project aims to make a website using blockchain technology to build an e-voting 
system. Blockchain technology is immutable, 
distributed, and incontrovertible, making this 
website more secure and robust. The vote is cast 
in the form of a transaction, where a blockchain 
is created, which keeps the track of the votes. 
The online voting system manages voter 
information by which voter can login and use his voting rights. The system will have blockchain technology to store the data of user and votes.
